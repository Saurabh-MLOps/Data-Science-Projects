# Disney Dataset Creation & Analysis

In this project we walk through a series of data science tasks to create a dataset on disney movies and analyze it using Python Beautifulsoup, requests, and several other libraries along the way.

## Setup

To access all of the files I recommend you fork this repo and then clone it locally. Instructions on how to do this can be found here: https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo

The other option is to click the green "clone or download" button and then click "Download ZIP". You then should extract all of the files to the location you want to edit your code.
